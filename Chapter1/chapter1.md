Computional processes are abstract things that manipulate data. The evolution of a process is direct by programmes which are patterns of rules. 

The lisp language is chosen here because it posses unique features that make it good for studying programming constructs and data structures. 
Lisp processes - procedures - can themselves be represented and manipulated as Lisp data. 

## 1.1 Elements of Programming

A language serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. Every powerful language has 3 mechanisms for accomplishing this:

- Primitive Expressions.
The simplest entities the language is concerned with

- Means of Combination
Compound elements are built from simpler ones

- Means of abstraction
Compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.
