## Foreword

This gives a general overview of computer programming, it's importance and what it is. Much of it is a certain type of philosophical contemplation on computers and programming that isn't of interest to me. For instance: 

`Every computer program is a model, hatched in the mind, of a real or mental process` pxiii

This could be true, or it could not. Problems with Logical Positivism and it's undeniable decline put to one side, the verification principle advocated by several prominent members seems particularly suitable here: meaning - semantic content - of a proposition is determined by its ability to be empirically verified. This statement seems to not be so.
